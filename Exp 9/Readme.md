Network Security Lab (COM 511), B.Tech Cyber Security – MIET Jammu
Welcome to the repository for the Network Security Lab (COM 511) course, offered to B.Tech Cyber Security students at the Model Institute of Engineering and Technology (MIET), Jammu.

This repository contains the code, configurations, and demonstrations for experiments covered in the lab manual. The material is intended to give students practical exposure to cryptographic algorithms, authentication, secure communication protocols, intrusion detection, and network security tools.

Table of Contents
Each experiment is organized in its own folder (E1, E2, … E10) for easy navigation.

E1 – Implement and Analyze Classical Symmetric Ciphers (Caesar and Vigenère)
E2 – Generate SHA-256 Hash and Verify Data Integrity
E3 – Simulate User Authentication and Replay Attack Handling (Challenge–Response Protocol)
E4 – Generate and Verify X.509 Self-Signed Certificate (OpenSSL)
E5 – Capture and Analyze TLS Handshake using Wireshark
E6 – Establish Secure Remote Login using SSH
E7 – Analyze WPA2 Wireless Security and Capture Handshake
E8 – Sending and Receiving PGP Encrypted Email (Thunderbird)
E9 – Configure and Analyze IPsec VPN in Tunnel Mode
E10 – Setup and Test a Simple Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Snort
Usage
Each experiment is placed in its respective folder (e.g., E1, E2, …).
Open the folder to find source code, scripts, or instructions.
Python-based experiments (E1, E2, E3) can be executed using any IDE or Jupyter Notebook.
Wireshark, OpenSSL, SSH, Thunderbird, StrongSwan, and Snort are required for respective experiments.
