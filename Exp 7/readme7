# Wireshark & Aircrack-ng Experiment — Wireless Packet Capture & Analysis

This repository documents a cybersecurity experiment performed using **Wireshark**, **Npcap**, and **Aircrack-ng** to capture, analyze, and understand wireless network traffic.
The goal is to observe packet flow, monitor Wi-Fi frames, and understand how wireless security mechanisms work at a low level.

## 🧰 Tools and Techniques Used

### **1. Wireshark + Npcap**

* Used for capturing and analyzing packet-level traffic
* Npcap enables monitor mode and packet injection support on Windows
* Helpful in viewing wireless frames, management packets, and encryption details

### **2. Aircrack-ng Suite**

* Used for wireless auditing and testing
* Includes tools like:

  * `airmon-ng` → enable monitor mode
  * `airodump-ng` → capture wireless packets
  * `aireplay-ng` → optional packet injection
  * `aircrack-ng` → analyze captured packets

---

## 🛠️ Methodology Used

### **1. Set Environment**

Prepared a system with:

* Wireless adapter supporting **monitor mode**
* Npcap installed for Wireshark packet capture
* Aircrack-ng suite installed

### **2. Enable Monitor Mode**

Using Aircrack-ng:

```bash
airmon-ng start wlan0
```

This places the wireless interface into monitor mode, enabling raw packet capture.

### **3. Capture Packets**

Used:

* **airodump-ng** to capture wireless frames
* **Wireshark** to visually analyze captured packets

Command:

```bash
airodump-ng wlan0mon
```

### **4. Open Wireshark**

Selected monitoring interface (e.g., `wlan0mon`) to observe:

* Beacon frames
* Probe requests & responses
* Authentication frames
* Encrypted data frames

### **5. Apply Filters**

Example filters in Wireshark:

```
wlan
wlan.addr == <target-mac>
eapol
```

### **6. Analyze Captured Traffic**

Observed packet types, security protocols (WPA2/WPA3), and signal properties.

## 🔍 Analysis

### **1. Wireless Management Frames**

Wireshark showed:

* Beacon packets broadcasting SSID
* Probe requests from devices searching for networks
* Probe responses from nearby access points

This helps understand how Wi-Fi devices discover and join networks.

### **2. EAPOL Handshake Packets (If WPA/WPA2 Traffic Observed)**

Captured **4-way handshake** packets used in WPA/WPA2 authentication:

* These packets are essential for understanding secure Wi-Fi negotiation
* Aircrack-ng tools rely on this handshake to analyze Wi-Fi security

### **3. Encrypted Data Frames**

Majority of packets appeared as:

```
802.11 Data — Protected
```

This indicates that:

* Payload is encrypted
* Network uses WPA/WPA2/WPA3 security

Only metadata (MAC addresses, frame type, channel) is visible.

### **4. Usefulness of Wireshark + Aircrack-ng Together**

* Aircrack-ng enables raw capture in monitor mode
* Wireshark provides deep visualization and packet interpretation
  Together, they offer a powerful environment for wireless traffic analysis.

## 📝 Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates how **Wireshark**, **Npcap**, and **Aircrack-ng** can be used together for effective wireless network analysis.

Key conclusions:

* Monitor mode allows capturing raw Wi-Fi frames not normally visible.
* Wireshark clearly displays management, control, and encrypted data frames.
* Encrypted payloads confirm that modern Wi-Fi security (WPA/WPA2/WPA3) protects user data.
* The experiment helps understand how wireless communication works at the packet level and why encryption is essential for securing Wi-Fi networks.

This forms an important foundation for learning wireless security, penetration testing, and network forensics.
